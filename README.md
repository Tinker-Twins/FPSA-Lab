# Fluid Power Systems and Automation Lab @ SRMIST

This repository hosts the FluidSIM files developed as virtual prototypes of various fluid power systems and automation projects for testing and validation, before prototyping them using hardware components in the lab. These experiments were performed from July 2018 to November 2018.
