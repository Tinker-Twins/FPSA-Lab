# Fluid Power Systems and Automation Lab @ SRMIST

This repository is a part of course 15MH207J "Fluid Power Systems and Automation" at SRMIST (July 2018 - November 2018). It hosts the Festo FluidSIM files developed as virtual prototypes of various fluid power systems and automation projects for testing and validation, before prototyping them using hardware components in the lab.
